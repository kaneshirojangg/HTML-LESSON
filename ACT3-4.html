     <h1>Close to you</h1>
     <p>   
        Why do birds suddenly appear <br>
        Every time you are near? <br>
        Just like me, they long to be <br>
        Close to you <br>
        <br>
        Why do stars fall down from the sky <br>
        Every time you walk by? <br>
        Just like me, they long to be <br>
        Close to you <br>
        <br>
        On the day that you were born the angels got together <br>
        And decided to create a dream come true <br>
        So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold <br>
        And starlight in your eyes of blue <br>
        <br>
        That is why all the girls in town <br>
        Follow you all around <br>
        Just like me, they long to be <br>
        Close to you <br>
        <br>
        On the day that you were born the angels got together <br>
        And decided to create a dream come true <br>
        So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold <br>
        And starlight in your eyes of blue <br>
        <br>
        That is why all the girls in town <br>
        Follow you all around <br>
        Just like me, they long to be <br>
        Close to you <br>
        <br>
        Just like me, they long to be <br>
        Close to you <br>
        <br>
        Wa, close to you <br>
        Wa, close to you <br>
        Ha, close to you <br>
        La, close to you <br>
        <br>
        End
     </p>
